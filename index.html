    RRR[b] (subtitled onscreen as Roudram Ranam Rudhiram) is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic period action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the screenplay with V. Vijayendra Prasad.[9] Produced by D. V. V. Danayya under DVV Entertainment, the film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan as fictionalised versions of Indian revolutionaries Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju, respectively. It also features Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody and Olivia Morris in supporting roles. The film is a fictionalised tale of two historical freedom fighters, set in the Indian pre-independence era.[10]
    Rajamouli conceptualised the film by reimagining the lives of Sitarama Raju and Bheem, envisioning their meeting in 1920s Delhi as two formidable forces uniting to battle British colonial rule. The film was officially announced in March 2018, and principal photography began in November 2018 in Hyderabad. The production faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded in August 2021. RRR was shot extensively across India, with additional sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's songs and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril served as the production designer, and V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.
    Made on a budget of ₹550 crore,[11] RRR was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. The film was released theatrically on 25 March 2022 and became the first Indian film to be released in Dolby Cinema format. It received universal critical acclaim for its direction, screenwriting, cast performances, cinematography, soundtrack, action sequences and VFX. With ₹223 crore worldwide on its first day, RRR recorded the highest opening-day earned by an Indian film at the time. It emerged as the highest-grossing film in its home market of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, grossing over ₹406 crore.[12] The film grossed ₹1,300–1,387 crore worldwide, setting several box office records for an Indian film, becoming the fourth highest-grossing Indian film, the third highest-grossing Telugu film and the highest grossing Indian film of 2022 worldwide.[a]
    RRR was considered one of the ten best films of the year by the National Board of Review, making it only the second non-English language film ever to make it to the list.[13][14] The song "Naatu Naatu" won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 95th Academy Awards, making it the first song from an Asian film to win in this category. The win made RRR the first and only Indian feature film to win an Academy Award.[15][16] The film became the third Indian film and first Telugu film to receive nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, and won Best Original Song for "Naatu Naatu", making it the first Indian (as well as the first Asian) nominee to win the award.[17][18] RRR also won the awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Song at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards. At the 69th National Film Awards, the film won six awards, including Best Popular Feature Film, Best Music Direction (Keeravani) and Best Male Playback Singer (Kaala Bhairava for "Komuram Bheemudo").[19][20] RRR also fetched the state Telangana Gaddar Film Award for Best Feature Film.

It is both the sequel and the prequel to Baahubali: The Beginning, as well as the final installment in the Baahubali film duology. The film is set in fictional medieval India and centers on the rivalry between siblings Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallaladeva. Bhallaladeva conspires against Amarendra, leading to his death at the hands of Kattappa. Years later, Amarendra's son (Mahendra or Sivudu) seeks to avenge his father's demise.[19][20]
    The film was produced on an estimated budget of ₹250 crore, making it the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. Production began on 17 December 2015 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. The cinematography was handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, with editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. The production design was created by Sabu Cyril, while the action sequences were choreographed by King Solomon, Lee Whittaker, and Kecha Khamphakdee.[21] Visual effects were designed by Makuta VFX, with contributions from Adel Adili and Pete Draper. The music and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani. The film was released on 28 April 2017 in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada and Malayalam, and later dubbed in Japanese, Russian and Chinese. It was available in conventional 2D and IMAX formats and was the first Telugu film to release in 4K High Definition format.[22]
    Baahubali 2 was one of the most anticipated films of 2017, primarily due to the massive cliffhanger ending of its predecessor.[23][24] The film premiered on over 9,000 screens worldwide, with 6,500 screens in India, setting a record for the widest release of an Indian film.[25][26] Upon its release, Baahubali 2 like its predecessor, received widespread acclaim for its direction, storytelling, cinematography, themes, visual effects, music, action sequences, and performances.[27] The film grossed over ₹1810.60 crore worldwide, briefly becoming the highest grossing Indian film of all time, surpassing PK (2014). It collected approximately ₹792 crore worldwide within the first six days and became the first Indian film to gross over ₹1,000 crore. Within India, it set numerous records, becoming the highest-grossing film in Hindi, as well as in its original Telugu and Tamil languages. As of 2025, Baahubali 2 remains the highest-grossing film in India. It is currently the highest grossing Telugu film, highest-grossing Tamil film, the highest grossing South Indian film, and the second highest-grossing Indian film worldwide.[28] The film sold over 10 crore tickets during its box office run, marking the highest estimated admissions for any film in India since Sholay (1975).[29][30] It also ranks among the top 50 highest-grossing non-English films globally.
    Baahubali 2, along with its predecessor, is regarded as one of the most influential films in Indian Cinema.[31][32] It set new standards in large-scale filmmaking with its high budget, expansive action sequences, and franchise-building approach.[33][34][35][36][37] The film won the Saturn Award for Best International Film and three National Film Awards, including Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, Best Special Effects, and Best Stunt Choreographer. It also fetched the state Gaddar Award for Best Feature Film.[38][39] The Baahubali franchise also pioneered the pan-Indian film movement of dubbing the same film in multiple languages instead of remaking it.[40] A combined recut version of The Beginning and The Conclusion, titled Baahubali: The Epic, is scheduled to be theatrically released worldwide on 31 October 2025.
